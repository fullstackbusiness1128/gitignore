# A Collection of Useful .gitignore Templates

That's what we're trying to build. Please contribute
by [forking][fk] and sending a [pull request][pr].

Also **please** only modify **one file** per commit. This'll
make merging easier for everyone.

Here's a good **global** gitignore: <http://help.github.com/git-ignore/>

For more information on gitignore: [gitignore(5)][g5]
