# SlickEdit workspace and project files are ignored by default because
# typically they are considered to be developer-specific and not part of a
# project.  However, if multiple SlickEdit users are collaborating on a
# project, it is possible to store these files in the repository and share
# them among all developers because they do not contain user-specific data.
# To store these files in a repository, add the following two lines to the
# projectâ€™s .gitignore file:
# ----------
# !*.vpw
# !*.vpj
# ----------
*.vpw
*.vpj

# SlickEdit workspace history and tag files always contain user-specific
# data so they should not be stored in a repository.
*.vpwhistu
*.vpwhist
*.vtg
